For this project, I set up **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch and Kibana) to centralize logs from both **Linux** and **Windows** machines. The project involved configuring **Beats** (specifically Auditbeat and Winlogbeat) to send logs from the endpoints to Elasticsearch, enabling centralized log storage and real-time analysis.

With **Kibana**, I created dashboards to visualize the logs, which made it easy to monitor system activity and quickly identify issues or anomalies across the network. By the end of the project, I had a fully functional log management setup, which can be used for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis.
